# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
- Software testing like the one I have learned from this course (JUnit testing) is critical when it coming to ensuring proper functionality of the source code.
- Security is another topic that needs to be ensured either by adding functions or exceptions in the source code, or by implementing session-related authentication methods (maven repository).
- Overall, functional code that ensures security should be the foundation of any source code being published and used publically
# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- In a Scrum team there is usually a Scrum master, a Product owner, and couple Developers and Testers. User needs are usually communicated with the scrum master and product owner first, who then analyze the specific needs and come up with user stories.
- Using the user stories, developers and testers can come up with story points and epics that they can work on to come up with the specific source code that satisfied user needs.
# How do I approach designing software?
- In general, I would like to follow the SDLC when designing any software:
  - First: Understand user need
  - Second: Interpret user requirements into user stories
  - Third: Transform user stories into achievable epics
  - Fourth: Establish base code using these epics
  - Fifth: Work with testers to ensure the base code works and meets functional and security measures
  - Last: Integrate everything together and present to the user
